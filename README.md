# Py-Rat
Py-Rat is a AES encrypted reverse shell for exploitation of remote system when injected with its victim_side code coded in Python.

Then on the same port , once the victime side code is executed in the target machine then , attacker can issue the remote commands to the target system and can compromise the machine .

## Method to run 
for testing on localmachine:: 
open 1 terminal : 
run attacker_side_code.py 

open another terminal : 
run the victim_side_code.py : 
# check the port or you can change as you want but check ip/port carefully before executing both of the codes 
As everything is right , attacker_side terminal will recieve a shell from a client side erminal and you can issue commands here . ... /
